# Movie Draft Happy Fun Time <>

This is meant to be a user friendly app to help groups draft movies. It's meant to do as much of the busy work for you as it can. This is rather U.S. centric.

## What is a movie draft
First, full credit to Night Attack/NSFW Show, Diamond Club, and Chat Relm. The idea of a movie draft is not my own I simply wrote some software to help my coworkers and I conduct our own.

A movie draft is something like a fantasy sports draft... or so I'm told. Generally there are two drafts per year, the Summer Block Buster Season and the Winter Oscar Bait Season. A group of people get together with equal amounts of fake money to "buy" movies in the upsoming season. Roughly 30 movies are generally included in the draft and the group bids to own them. The goal is, two weeks after the last movies is released, to have the highest income from your owned movies using US domestic grosses.
